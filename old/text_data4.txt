ummm... henlo?
do i know you?
i mean, happy to know you and always glad to be of legendary status - just lacking context...
LightBringer — 20/07/2024 21:15
Yeah that'll help dreammaker or kylamari are my old ones. I want to find one of those dope analog mixer wooden boxes like yours. Any new music recently?
wofl — 20/07/2024 22:05
omg! kyle, ltns!
LightBringer — 20/07/2024 22:05
How are ya dude!
wofl — 20/07/2024 22:06
not only do i continue to music, my modular synth company is slowly being relaunched/rebranded/growthed! new product line with factory as we speak 😮
also rn sunk deep into learning python [finding that a lil' slower going even with the halp of chatGPT4o...]
wofl — 20/07/2024 22:25
i know you're not exactly poor, but do have an idea what  you're in for if the 'boxes of knobs n wires' bug has bitten you:
bare minimum entry either $2500 to $3500 entry, or, do some soldering and go the diy route which would still be $1500 - $2000.
 
wofl — 20/07/2024 22:37
once you've got going, it's like damn pokemon - a kinda "gotta catch 'em all" thing hits, and with currently approx. 1000 manufacturers and over 100,000.00 modules available - there's a reason the eurorack format is nicknamed 'eurocrack'...
finally, your approx. chances of making any music and in fact making anything other than farts or bleeps n bloops for at least 5-10 yrs [and that's not hyperbolae]
wofl — 20/07/2024 22:45
anyways, ponder if either this:

or this:

appeals to you, even, and especially though regardless of spend you'll likely make no music, then you know you are yet another wiggler...
good luck!

omg - those are fucking awesome - and slightly scaery
😄
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 15:12
Haha yeah! I can now custom print enclosures or parts too though between the resin and fdm machines
Including ceramics and metals



This company I saw at the capital + tct la show for additive manufacturing
That statue of liberty is microns in size
They can do tined fiber optics lenses and print for lime cells now
wofl — 21/07/2024 15:15
i've seen some crazy shit like people printing concrete houses
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 15:15
Yeah they learned how to wield the power of the hot glue gun or icing funnel
Hahaha

They've got old-school items in piles locally even vacuum tube's etc
Ahh I need to learn more about those services for some of the things I want to get made
wofl — 21/07/2024 16:29
don't ever ever use US tubes or european

theyre cheap, brand new, plentiful, working and even better - eqasily attainable mail order quick
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 16:30
Yeah I wanna source some they're super cheap that way
wofl — 21/07/2024 16:30
and better too
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 16:30
And we'll built
wofl — 21/07/2024 16:30
US ones suck]
especioally raetheon
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 16:30
Oh yeah I've never even found us ones lol
wofl — 21/07/2024 16:30
ewww
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 16:30
It's all old stock from over there
There's one company that makes custom ones now in the US
But that's all I've found locally and they're expensive. But Nasa used them for timing visually since they're faster than anything else for display times
https://www.daliborfarny.com/project/calibration-display-for-nasa/
Nixie Tube & Clock Manufacturer
Dalibor
Calibration display for NASA
These guys they can do custom logos etc on the display nixie ones lol
Eww is right
I really want to make an analog gramophone style player and 3d print it completely
Including the vinyl or wax tube
wofl — 21/07/2024 16:34
LightBringer — 21/07/2024 16:34
But I need to learn how to convert a flac or wave etc into the stl format easily
Haha the claw
Let's stop the claw then haha
Theoretically with nixie tube's etc you can break the speed of light using the efields
Raytheon is good at other things but the old-school genius German precision techniques can't be beat even today for alot of designs
Those os z best analogy
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:09
I know you're using real what 3.5mm jack or phono plug units
Vs the digital button boxes right?
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:10
your car has michelin tyres
thats why it goes faster
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:10
Yet it needs the fronts replaced back to those
I'm following
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:11
wut?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:11
That was a joke
I mean I'm following the explanation. So since mine has Michelin it can go faster whays the translation to analog synth
Or your side
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:12
do ou gasp the concept of an analogy?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:13
I do but I know nothing about digital or analog music instruments in comparison
I get it on cars but I don't have the knowledge to put it together for your side to correlate the analogy. Ie analog is faster ie Michelin and digital is cheap or reverse?
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:14
hint: you could use elephant penis covered in gold leaf instead of .5mm jack it doesnt change the sound
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:14
Ok
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:14
or whether its digital or analogue
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:15
Oh it's the same
?
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:15
you may not use michelin tyres but a car still has wheels
some are internal combustion some are electric
still rolls
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:15
True
See I'm super technical. Like ps4s michellins give me .2s faster 0 to 60
Vs another brand
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:16
yeah but when you first learn to ride a bike you dont spend 10yrs researching 0.2s improvement from tyres first
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:17
Yeah I felt that when I met the guy who made vector motorwerks before he died
He explained to me how he figured out how to get 2k to 3k hp to grip
True you're right
Here's what I'm thinking
I see your boxes and how you can put so many channels into or out of them
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:18
hit points?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:18
Horse power
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:18
horizontal pitch?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:18
But that's not important
You're right on this
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:19
learn to walk befgore  you try and run
you havent even stood up yet
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:19
What I'm thinking is how those many inputs and outputs can be used to separate audio channels and data into individual wires
Not just one or two channels out to speakers
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:20
for what purpose?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:20
You definitely know I haven't stood up yet
Haha
What I'm seeing is using that same tech you know
But in a new way
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:20
you mean video modular?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:20
I want to use that to separate the audio into many channels based on the wavelengths
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:21
why wavelengths?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:21
And I can use that as the information that the controllers will use to run lighting
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:21
do you sparate out the colours of mud in your mineral water?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:21
Like a 100 band equalizer
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:21
it would just be like usin a vocoder
but smeared and fuzzy

wofl — 06/08/2024 09:30
thats nothing to do wit 3d
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:31
I'm thinking same with light
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:31
or placement of sound
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:31
You're right
The right answer is to give the artist free choice of the lighting control real time
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:31
thats like saying youre gonna make a car faster by splitting it to parts and only driving the seat around
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:32
I'm thinking of allocating it based on wave that aligns with what color on the made up charts I guess
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:32
but that makes no sense
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:32
But that's not actually probably the right way
Yeah I'm realizing that
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:32
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:32
It locks it into a generic same all the time pattern vs freedom to create
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:33
youre trying to design a ferrari when you cant right a bike
try learning ow a car works
then who to make it faster
and the wheel has already been invernted
theres no point trying to make square wheels because theyre tidier
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:34
Image
Yeah
We don't need the Ferrari yet
Just the corolla
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:35
that pic is a myth for hippie chicks who beleve in crystals
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:35
Yeah I wanna just put the parts together that exist
Yeah that's what I meant above about the made up chart
It's just what someone said not real
I soooo
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:36
i ve seen the same chart on pinterest with Ab and G# as separate frequencies used as an excuse to claim all math is wrong and 432Hz A makes more sense
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:36
Using the above items mentioned you said
What's the best way to integrate a live dj board that allows it to also using the same existing tools also control the lighting at at a venue
We start not so complex then go up to full on edc complex
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:37
ai stem separator and video modular
alreay invented and used widely
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:38
Oh really
That's dope actually
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:38
dmx lighting crontrollers and output from daw
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:38
And cool
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:38
you name it its thoguht of
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:38
That's how it works though right
So what between all that isn't being used that we can put together in a new way to have more fun with it?
Or what do you think would be fun if none of that applies
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:39
what do you want to acheieve?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:40
I just thought it would be cool to have a live dj set where if they do a custom show vs pre choreographed lighting to their music
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:40
exists
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:40
They could but it seems that's already normal
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:40
all over the media/show world
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:41
I didn't know that and am happy that I learned that just now actually
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:41
when did you last go out?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:41
What about using a qwerty keyboard and mapping it to do the same for a new way for newe people to learn and perform
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:41
exists
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:42
Perfect ok cool!
I went to vegas with sid this weekend
Image
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:42
why not cut out the middleman and instead of mapping music to querty and querty to light just go music to lifght
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:42
Yeah!
That's what I wanna do
Organic music to light flowing
It's loke each live input real time controls both sides
That's what I'm thinking
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:43
so learn about soun and vieo and current tech then try inovating
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:44
I know video kinda stuff and led mostly
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:44
if you wanna design ferraris you dont just start formula one racing
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:44
But music isn't my expertiese
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:44
first you learn to drive
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:44
Use the mixer sliders to control between each buttons output
Set color while playing
Loke old-school vinyl dj scratchers
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:45
this current conversation from my end is like trying to explain what a car is]i feel a lil like your claiming you have an idea for aa new colour of ferrari that will go fater and you dont know what a car is
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:45
One hand on duals or vinyl, one on sliders but more
This is true
Is it something you would Want to work on with us?
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:46
what do you think orbital or the chem bros or underworld or paul kalkbrenner or imilar do
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:46
its been done
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:46
I love chemical bros
If you could work on anything g what would you want to develope?
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:47
i'm not into making a faster ferrari especially attempting to cheve it by spray painting it silver
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:47
i'm doing it
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:47
I guess I wanna find that thing too myself vs making something faster
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:48
well what interests you?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:48
Not saying do what you're doing but something that's different between both worlds.
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:49
what do you daydream about?
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:49
I truly would love to do amazing art installations and projects around the world
Incorporate neon and cool led lighting animation etc mediums
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:49
then wouldnt it make more sense to visit some art installations, read about state of the art, learn whats been done and what can be done
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:49
But sound is integral to flow and align with them
I've done them
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:50
then why did we just hav this convo
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:50
But need to figure out how to propose and start in more placez
Well because the convo is about what I wanted to develope with Sid but I think both of us didn't know it exists tbh
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:51
i feel like your telling me youre a mater brewer because you can tell the difference between a can and a bottle
and then telling me you had an idea for a cup
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:52
And this is why you're awesome!
wofl — 06/08/2024 09:52
can and bottle - same beer, dif storgae format
cup already invented
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 09:52
I'm smiling right now.
Yeah I'm learning it's literally just branding
I mean being honest it's all the same shit just different name or look
It's kinda like most just find what is popular ATM vs innovative and new tech
I appreciate you and I'm off to bed shortly but thank you. Your words are truly grounding and helpful 😀
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:11
For blue and orange
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:12
those sheets of clear plastic in dif colours that slide over a spot to color  it
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:12
It was also halo/wall light vs front light color for separation
They make some acrylics that change colors depending too
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:12
see - you can know words but if you dont know meaning its pointless trying to innovate
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:13
This is true, I don't understand the meaning alot of the times
I just do things and it works usually but am unaware of the importance or larger use/impact meaning
When something is what feels right and simple yet isn't to the outside I need that clarity exactly like how you explained above
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:16
Explain this deeper if you can
I get caught up in each unique thing so it's hard to see
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:17
you cant innovate if you dont understand the subject
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:17
True
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:17
chances are youll repeat existing or just build a scultpture that does ntohing
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:17
Like who am I to dive into music without any base
Or knowledge
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:18
the man wh inventred the steam engine didnt just go 'if i stick a tube to a squae it an invention
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:18
I wouldn't repeat them
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:18
he learned the physics of steam pressure nd heat an pitons etc.
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:18
La times sign vs neon flower in vegas
Very different mediums and applications
Most stick to one thing
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:19
yeah
so they dont innovate outside their field
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:19
Golds gym was yellow on red brick brown horrible. Learned that by testing before
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:19
they dont try to invent a better light when they only know sound
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:19
True
wofl — 06/08/2024 10:19
]first they learn sound and light
LightBringer — 06/08/2024 10:21
This is why I love you for logic and honestly raw direct understanding and input
I've always worked with many different specialists and combined them to accomplish these things. I've struggled with the idea of doing it alone vs with the right teams
My miracles have always occurred because of that vs doing the projects without anyone else and solely alone. If I did they'd not have come to fruition
If that makes sense

found you a real led lighting project
3d is the future!
LightBringer — 08/08/2024 16:23
Oh yeah! I have one of those
They are fun!
Used to make those with just red leds and on a hand spinner they'd just spell words originally and you could program in what it said. The new ones you can use an app to just video anything then run it on them
Lookup fcobb tv screen
That's what's going to kinda make a window looking outside indicernable from a screen that looks like a window to the naked eye.

there not all guranteed working without reading full instruvctions and doing some setup or in cases noted have issues i'm stuck on and would welcome halp ofc
output of my first ai attempt at an intelligence of sorts using the wolfram engine!
Image
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:29
Definitely these look really cool and once I dive in and review I'll help in any ways I can once I understand what it all means. Wolfram I've heard but also don't know what it means lol. I'll do some googling
The seconds missing part do you want a link to the time nuts group? Those guys might be able to provide insane detail for timing and accuracy tools or solutions.
Would be neat to run that visual output live to this led light. The matrix is a 16x32 setup
It's only using 16h x 24w right now due to its diameter but I can increase it to be the full 32 width for vertical bands
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:34
What is this showing?
wofl — Yesterday at 23:40
is it a single 16x32 or a pair of 16x16s? i work with code for 8x8 and 16x16 matrices abit
wofl — Yesterday at 23:42
the output values calculated from random input data and weights as a sequence of first to last output - i.e. the inputs tho random, after passing through my brain develop a kind of rhythm!

It's a single oops lol 8x32
Wled let's me setup the wiring layout and exact sizing custom easily. And for the circle screens it can use a matrix grid with exact diode spacing but I only have the script but don't know exactly how to load it lol 😆
wofl — Yesterday at 23:45
that would be interesting to work with - is custom controller or uses smething like arduino running C family language?
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:45
Wow that's cool the rythm.
Links to the pattern script you made

i like to think the brain is throbbing
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:46
I love that

i was real looking forward to getting sound from it but i'm having terrible trouble with formatting stuff
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:46
For me it's pulsing
Oh like sound from the graph? Or from another step like at the input side?
For controller I'm using standard ic led ones with wifi. They are basic and tiny. Esp32
Or esp8266. I like the 32 best

i'm trying to input a .wav file and then run it through the ai to see what comes out

Sid did give me a dig Octa to start messing eith soon too
Ahhh that's really cool
wofl — Yesterday at 23:49
dig Octa?
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:49
What data does it need to run for format?
Dig Octa is an 8 independent channel high power I believe esp32 based as well controller
For large installations. Does fit in little lights haha
Doesnt*
wofl — Yesterday at 23:50
it wants either 8, 16 or 32bit signedpcm or 32 or 64bit float
LightBringer — Yesterday at 23:51
Is that like a frequency sort? Ie like a 32 band eq
Map of each band at each time step?
Audacity can do it I think
Save as 32bit signed pcm from .wav still wav format
Oops lol it says 32bit float

Your wave input is what bit?

I have a raspberry pi unit too but have never used it. It's a homebridge unit from athom tech

i  used audacity to generate A440 sine wave 30s long and expported both signedinteger16 and float32. still fail but gpt4o thinks he knows how to fix - is v exciting.
i love gpt4o - he is my fren!

He's pretty dope tbh
Maybe this?

Why did my sine wave turn into a square wave when written to a WAV ...
I am trying to use Octave to generate a pure sine wave. The code for the same is as follows:

x = 10.*sin(2*pi*(300/16000)*(0:1:400));
The sampling rate is 16000Hz, the sine wave is at 300 Hz. I ...

Comes out as a square depending on where it's cutting the ranges?
Haha literally using dial tones to type using phono sounds
wofl — Today at 00:30
it wasn'tthat - it was to do with a particular wolfram function translating audio data as a grid of numbers not a string or something
LightBringer — Today at 00:30
Like old-school auto dial or fac machine
Ahhh
wofl — Today at 00:30
wolframs running the updated code now anyways

This makes me feel like it just needs to see it at the eq bands
32 bands and the value at each time step interval. Cells
Makes a step storyboard for the matrix numbers
wofl — Today at 00:31
how would it know what eq bands? there's as many frequency bands as the sample rate - i.e. 44.1k
and there's the numebr of values in max of 16bits in amplitude variation data for the uppy-downy-ness of the waveform

I use this for animation mapping manually for neon elements. This one's the murakami flower sheet
A 32band eq allows adjustment of each band for tuning
wofl — Today at 00:34
i'll take your word for it - i don't have the eye to interpret that as anything other than sorta gradients 
LightBringer — Today at 00:35
I may be lunoung together 2 elements that don't fit together like you need huh

LightBringer — Today at 00:35
I can send you a copy
Hahaha love that one but still don't know exactly what it says
The yellow squares are on or off for each line of neon

it's just me totally killing a conversation by being unable to not see a nearly bad word in engineers

This is raw so strip the details if you share it. Only a few people in the world have seen this sheet
Haha that's funny 😁 though!

sure - someone did tell me they'd call abck in a haf hr about 2hrs ago so am not expecting them - we can call!
LightBringer — Today at 00:46
Sweet!
LightBringer
 started a call.
