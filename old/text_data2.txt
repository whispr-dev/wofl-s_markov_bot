Rewind: Paul & Fritz Kalkbrenner ‎- Sky And Sand

Ten years on, we revisit the masterstroke that helped define the sound of Berlin.
Share




Rewind is a review series that dips into electronic music's archives to dust off music from decades past.

For anyone paying attention in the '00s, Berlin's electronic music scene will be forever associated with minimal, tech house and laptops. Artists and labels, many of them recent migrants to the city, embraced dance music in its most reduced form, twisting house and techno into ultra-loopy grooves embellished with clicks and clacks, bleeps and blops. But that's not the full story. Where some artists expanded the possibilities of reduction, others made their case with melody. Paul Kalkbrenner, along with artists like Sascha Funke and Acid Pauli, was a leader among this group. Across classy early releases for BPitch Control, beginning with dB+ in 2000, his skill for touching tones was clear, whether working with lean dub techno ("Eins"), deep house ("D.E.E.P") or less subtle party tracks ("Mundgucci.") But nothing would showcase Kalkbrenner's songwriting touch like "Sky And Sand," a track that propelled him to stardom.  

"Sky And Sand" was originally produced as the title song for Berlin Calling, a tragicomedy depicting the hospitalisation of a fictional DJ, played by Kalkbrenner, for drug abuse. The director, Hannes Stöhr, enlisted Kalkbrenner for the film's music after hearing his 2004 album, Self. "Sky And Sand" was released on the official soundtrack in October 2008, before being given a standalone single release by BPitch Control the following February, where it was presented as an extended, eight-minute version on a low-key, single-sided vinyl. This longer version, previously unavailable, highlights the subtleties of Kalkbrenner's approach: the slow build, the tension, the energy's  calm rise and fall. "Sky And Sand" has entranced millions of listeners—it remained in the German singles charts for over two years—but it's still a conventional dance music track, each element introduced with the patience of classic minimal. But few minimal tracks touch people like this, the vocals of Fritz Kalkbrenner forming magic partnership with his brother's rising tones.

Paul produced "Sky And Sand," along with the rest of Berlin Calling's soundtrack, with Sascha Funke. The pair, both natives of East Berlin, had been friends since childhood, discovering the city's techno scene together as teenagers. By the time they relocated southern France to craft the Berlin Calling soundtrack in late 2006, they each had a string of well-received records in their catalogues. But nothing would match the success of its standout tune. Produced during a cold French winter, Berlin Calling's melancholy tones were a perfect match for the film's bleak plot and setting, where a troubled young man navigates a harsh environment. Yet there was a sense of hope and happiness in much of the soundtrack, especially "Sky And Sand."
  
This is partly thanks to Fritz. A music journalist at the time, he was a former hip-hop fan who switched to techno when he discovered clubbing. For "Sky And Sand," he penned a reflection on love, clubbing and companionship.
  
In the daytime
You'll find me by your side
Tryin' to do my best
And tryin' to make things right
When it all turns wrong
But it won't hit hard
'cause you let me shine

As with much great electronic music, "Sky And Sand" and its lyrics are ambiguous in mood. The feeling a listener pulls from the track may change depending on their emotional state—sad one day, happy the next. It’s a masterstroke by a producer whose life changed upon its release. Already a respected name in Germany, Kalkbrenner's international profile shot skywards, making him one of dance music's true superstars. "Nobody came," he said about a 2006 gig in New York. "It was very depressing." In the months following the release of "Sky And Sand," more than 125,000 people bought tickets to his live dates.

Perhaps more than anything, the success of "Sky And Sand" shows the power of well-crafted melody. It wriggles into your brain, there's never a push. Building up and down over eight introspective minutes, it's the high point of a Berlin scene that gave us dozens of great dance tracks, all pushing a similarly hard-to-place mood. Other tunes from Sascha Funke (who also contributed the excellent solo track "Mango" to Berlin Calling), Acid Pauli and Daso Franke, who we revisited last year, remain exceptionally powerful, the sounds of scene where, sometimes, music was fuelled by feeling, not only the dance floor.

Nightlife Dept.
The Kush That Keeps Paul Kalkbrenner Up All Night
Berlin’s chimeric club-scene icon searches for new strains in Brooklyn.

By Nick Paumgarten

May 14, 2018

Image may contain Text and Stencil
The Germans had meetings in Manhattan. The last one was at the Hofbräu Bierhaus, a very intentional beer hall in midtown. It hadn’t been their idea, but there they were, sitting at a picnic table in the middle of the afternoon facing down meaty steins of lager, talking about techno with Austin Kramer, Spotify’s global head of dance-music curation. “He’s doing all the large playlists,” one of them said. “He’s the kingmaker.”

The principal German was Paul Kalkbrenner, the techno artist from Berlin, who was in town to perform for two nights in Brooklyn. The others were his manager, Marcus Ruschmeyer, and his friend Olaf Heine, a photographer.

Kalkbrenner, his head shaved but stubbled, had on black drop-crotch sweatpants, flower-patterned high-tops, a black hoodie, and an olive-green bomber jacket. Sehr Kreuzkölln. He sipped his beer carefully. It was his first drink in a month. “I hate alcohol,” he said. But he loves marijuana. He had a little white clutch that held cannisters of varietals. “I smoke all day, but I don’t get stoned. I was smoking the Granddaddy Purple since five this morning. Now I’m looking for some nice Kush.”

Kalkbrenner, who is forty, has been producing electronic music in dance clubs since the early days of German reunification. Reared in East Berlin, he was twelve when the Wall came down, and passed his adolescence dancing in the city’s new techno clubs, such as Tresor and E-Werk, while learning to cut and perform tracks himself. He is careful to insist that he is not a d.j. He doesn’t stitch together the music of others. He makes his own, mixing it live, on an analog Midas Venice 240 console. His turn as Ickarus, the addled d.j. protagonist of the 2008 cult film “Berlin Calling,” made him an icon of the city’s chimeric club scene and also earned him a hit, “Sky and Sand.” For a time, he veered toward Moby-ish major-label electronic pop. For his 2015 release, “7,” Sony let him loose in its vault so that he could borrow vocal parts from the likes of Luther Vandross, D Train, and Grace Slick. Now he has veered rootsward again, first with the 2016 mixtape series “Back to the Future,” a tribute to the early days of the Berlin underground scene, and now with the release, this month, of an album called “Parts of Life.”

The Germans got into an S.U.V. to head out to Brooklyn, to set up for the gig, which was scheduled to begin at 2 a.m.

Liturgy of Anti-Tank Obstacles: When Artists Prepare for War


“Two to 4 a.m. is something that happened in Paul’s life a lot ten years ago,” Ruschmeyer said.

“Two a.m. is hard now: no more marching powder,” Kalkbrenner said, his accent bringing to mind Werner Herzog discussing the stupidity of chickens. He and his wife, Simina Grigoriu, a Romanian-Canadian techno d.j. and producer, have a three-year-old daughter. “I like to play daytime into nighttime, but not nighttime into daytime. The light comes in and you see all the ravers.” He contorted his face into the expression of a fiend shrinking from the sun. “When you are leaving a club and see the people out with their kids, you feel worse.” He had a theory about festivals. “It is better to be second last,” he said. “Yes, to be last means you are the big one, but it is better to be second last, so that when you are done you don’t have to watch everyone cleaning up and putting the chairs upside down.”

The S.U.V. inched forward on the F.D.R. Drive. Kalkbrenner, slouched in the back seat, said that he first came to New York in 1999. He and a friend stayed at a hotel by Newark Airport. “We walked around. Looked at shit. Hoped no one in the shops would talk to me. ‘Only looking.’ That was the only English I knew.” He came back in 2006 to perform. “Nobody came. It was very depressing.” He lives in Mitte and still prizes Berlin’s laid-back vibe. “In New York, you have to pay much, much more for your much, much smaller apartments, and so you have to work much, much more.”

New York is also vast. As the S.U.V. nosed through Brooklyn, Kalkbrenner’s energy began to flag. Jet lag, beer. The plan was to set up, run through a few songs, then return to the hotel for a disco nap. The club, called Elsewhere, was in a rugged corner of East Williamsburg, with a fleet of cement trucks parked out front. They arrived to find their crew—more Germans—milling around a stage, assembling lights, cameras, and mixing machines. Kalkbrenner retreated to a backstage room and got to work rolling a joint of Granddaddy Purple and mentholated tobacco. Ruschmeyer popped in. “I have some very interesting news for you that will make you very happy,” he said. “The man with the briefcase is coming.”

“Kush,” Kalkbrenner said, smiling.

Not long afterward, he went out onto the stage and began to play. Exuding rejuvenation, he manipulated knobs and dials, tapped buttons and screens, and bobbed to the sounds produced by these exertions. Three times he ran through the track called “Part Ten.” Techno. Beams of light swirled around the nearly empty club. In the back, by the bar, there was a man with a briefcase, sipping on a can of Red Bull. ♦

`SPEEDING UP RECORDS
Sean RossbySean Ross 5
Police Every Breath You TakeHas “Every Breath You Take” gotten slower over the years?

In Top 40’s comeback summer of 1983, it registered as a punchy, uptempo smash at a time when there was increasing presentational excitement at the stations that played it. It wasn’t frenetic like Duran Duran’s “Is There Something I Should Know.” It didn’t gallop along like Michael Jackson, “Wanna Be Startin’ Something,” or Michael Sembello, “Maniac.” But I remember it as a hot record on hot stations.

In 1983, more than a few people noticed the resemblance between the bridge of “Every Breath You Take” and its counterpart, Leo Sayer’s hit remake of “More Than I Can Say” a few years earlier. The Sayer hit was the stolid sound of the 1980-81 CHR doldrums. One sapped the excitement of the format, one was the sound of excitement returning to CHR radio.  

In recent years, “Every Breath” feels more sluggish, and it’s a comment I’ve heard echoed from others. On a 1-5 tempo scale, I still think of it as a “4,” but others call it a “3.” It feels less vibrant to me now. Is it because I’ve heard it so many times over the years? Is it because I now think of it as refracted through its revved-up interpolation, Puff Daddy’s “I’ll Be Missing You”? 

I started thinking about this because reader Richard Phelps, as part of a dialogue about overplayed songs, noted that Australian Hot AC station Hot Tomato had played it boosting the tempo 2.5%. “Subtle, but it worked on me” in restoring energy to a song that he was otherwise tired of, Phelps said. 

That got me wondering if I was hearing “Every Breath You Take” faster in 1983. In the years just before CHR’s rebound, speeding up records — whether the intent was to sound hotter than the competition or shove in a few more songs over the course of a few hours — was considered an anachronism of the “boss radio” ‘60s and screaming Q-format ‘70s. Some stations literally sped up songs. Some could speed tempo without interfering with pitch; that’s a pretty standard feature of audio software now, but the Eventide Harmonizer was a fancy piece of equipment to own at the time. 

In the pre-CHR-comeback early ‘80s, a few stations, such as XETRA (The Mighty 690) San Diego, sped up songs, but it was an old-school tactic and a decidedly contrarian choice. Within a few years, as the presentational excitement returned to CHR, there were some stations that added jingles, allowed the jocks more vocal enthusiasm (although not a screaming ‘70s level), but still didn’t speed up their music.

The station credited with starting the format comeback, Mike Joseph’s “Hot Hits” WCAU-FM Philadelphia, did, by multiple accounts, speed up songs. WCAU-FM restored honor to a lot of CHR traditions, including jingles and high-energy jocks. 

But two of the format’s most-watched stations did not speed their records. “Hot Rockin’ Flamethrowing Z100 [WHTZ] New York” elaborately EQ’ed its songs, but only rival WPLJ, the station it derided as “wimp radio,” sped them up 2-3%, depending on who you ask. “Things that I carted at Z100 were not sped up, because I have perfect pitch, and it would drive me nuts,” recalls the station’s Anita Bonita. 

KIIS Los Angeles, which evolved from Hot AC, did not boost songs even when new rival KKHR (Hitradio 93) sped them 3%. “I hated the practice,” recalled then-APD Mike Schaefer. “It makes my ears bleed.” But the short lived “Car Radio” incarnation of KHJ Los Angeles was “the worst example I ever heard.” 

When KIIS’s success led to the launch of KSDO-FM (KS103) San Diego, that station did speed up songs, according to Mike Preston. But the 2.5% that might have been a big boost elsewhere sounded subtle compared to the Mighty 690. Other major stations that readers remember for running songs fast include WKSE (Kiss 98.5) Buffalo; WXKS (Kiss 108) Boston, but mostly on ballads; KSFM (FM102) Sacramento, Calif.; and WNCI Columbus, Ohio

Various Syracuse, N.Y., stations sped up records between the ‘70s and ‘90s in an intensively competitive market. Peter King remembers getting to Full-Service AC WHEN and having to recart songs that had been goosed. Randy Kabrich’s WROQ (95Q) Charlotte, N.C., is remembered fondly for its processing overall, but John McFadden recalls how a 2% boost helped win a three-way CHR battle within a year.

Only the most blatant stations were easy for listeners to spot. But sometimes rivals helped. John Gorman remembers on-air shaming a competitor, likely CHR WGCL (G98), out of speeding up songs with a promo of a sped-up Phil Collins. In the ‘90s, Jason Steiner remembers KWNR Las Vegas morning man John Potter devoting a whole show to rival KFMS speeding up records, a practice it shortly discontinued.

Radio veteran Jeanne Ashley remembers her daughter, who also had perfect pitch, hearing a local station that pitched up songs. “She’d ask me, ‘Why does the music sound so stupid on this station? It’s a smidge high and all wrong. Turn if off.’”

Speeding up songs now is as easy as adjusting a setting in radio station automation. ROR readers hear a scattering of stations in all formats that speed up music today. It’s often as likely to be their local Country or Hot AC station as Top 40.

When it comes to Classic Hits, I’m for it if it adds some excitement to “Every Breath You Take” or “Don’t Stop Believin’” as they play 2-3x a day on our biggest Classic Hits stations. Over the years, any number of songs aren’t played the way they were in 1983, whether it’s excising the intro from Pat Benatar’s “We Belong” or institutionalizing the album versions of songs that CHR never played as currents. I’d rather hear the hits as I remember them, even if it’s not what an act wanted on its greatest-hits compilation.

As for CHR, there’s still a variance of opinions. Is it the right thing for today’s trap-pop, often slow and repetitive in a way that could certainly sound even more jarring sped up? What about current bedroom pop? Are those the songs that most need boosting? Or the songs that least accommodate it? How much more fun can you get out of Justin Bieber, “Lonely”?

“I still pitch,” says Shaun Andrews of WSKS Utica, N.Y. “It makes the songs vibrant, even more so now that the music isn’t so much naturally.”

“I stopped about five years ago,” says WJFX (Hot 107.9) Fort Wayne, Ind., PD Rob Mack. “Now sources for music are limitless. When most of my listeners also use Spotify, Apple, or some other platform in addition to the station, I want the songs to sound the way they know them to sound, with a little sweetening in the processing.”

One complicating factor is the number of stations and groups that now share music. Consultant Mike Donovan recalls a station combo where an AC inadvertently sped up songs because it was sourcing them from the CHR library.

My programming education was such that I became aware of sped-up records in the early ‘80s when CHR product was at a low point. It was certainly noticeable when you heard the stately “Out Here on My Own” by Irene Cara or “With You I’m Born Again” by Billy Preston & Syreeta juiced to the point where they were almost midtempo. But it didn’t necessarily solve anything.

As we talk about what radio needs this summer — tempo, music enterprise, more hits overall, a return to music enterprise — there’s not much that merely speeding up songs will help. It would be a happy occurrence to see a market supporting two CHR or even two Country stations in the near future where speeding records is a secret weapon, but first we have to get there.`

[btw, god bless chordify for classifying genre as 'preogressive house. :)
someone was old enough to be around before this started being called 'minimal'. i need alot of people to go see ritchie hawtin 20yrs ago and learn what real fucking minimal is.]


so tidying up
Ab	Bbm	Db	Gb
Cm	Fm	Bb	C
Gbm	F	Eb	Abm

run midi playng ableton 128 version in C against midi recording of 131 sloweddown pitchift algo from the Abmaj version which unsurprisingy with a very slight cheat can bea nailed phase perfect when crossfader played with

fun fact - when slightly detune verion, fae a lil in and you get a sorta honky tonk piano effect which could be used in all kindsa creative ways most likely...


compare chordify to 'abl extract' - paul's real [god bless him imported to ableton it hits bang on perfec loop/syncwarp etc. and too about 1 mn from dl beatport to midi chord loop] :

paul's real when compared to able ccan be seen to be vey seemingly odd choice oof notes missedout nd duplicateds.

now see my chordify f=ineversions so its all c roots

now see all 3 compared

now look again at the chordify originls in 1st inversion a=same octave - its a smile but slightly skewed - both phappy but melanccholy.

superimpose screenshot on a smiley bith done with tritone newsprint dots - linky to how its done in gimp/inc=kscape.
[make 2 x tritone, ither dif sets of three cols r not but fade one lr and one r-l then merge]



break it onto an overall 8 blocks of 2 bars each, and its a descending staircase scale for first 3 pairs of  blocks, bar 6 is  hold of the bar 5 bottom of scale. thee last two bars are a climb back to the start.
all of this is achieved whilst alternating each pair going min to major alternating brs so there's an ever present small scale uplift cadence to keep it bouyed, and tho the stircase has this bleakly melancholy crash, it rescues us back to carry on with a euhorically triumhaant uplift.
the fct all this is basically a mix of chord inversions arpund a very limited spaccing of chords to achieve both the constant presence min-to-maj bouyancy and also contain the decending then ascending melodic scale as a core part of the whole structure not just some repeating drone with messy jazz sorta forced on top or a complex string of hard to follow hords progressing with no easy to hook onto intutive pattern surely is part of the key to the magic.
it''s so elegant it's like one of those simple equations that  turn outto describe the entire universe - it's an entire emotional relationship captured in three alternating note pairs each with a variation option. 2 x [3 x 2] notes to generate an entire emtional relationship musically. :O


when looking at the inversions, if some are flippe to [2nd?]you can see it's 16bars x 4/4 broken into 8bloks:
downup x4
when you then analyse this closer, can be split root/mid/top[find words] -one variation of each - so 3 x2m, going b a c a:

this when  laid on the updown fives b u/d, a u/d, c u/d, a u/c - 8 bloks!

so simples!

and the fact it goes from up to mid to lower to up gives the skew smiley we saw before  :O







also now, look at my attempt to play with pauls chord pattern adding some extra lil nots to make eaach chord flow one to another

as pjanoo is a bit mess but a subtle flowing strings in background with pjanoo and bass is real nice yet  some how kills sone thing special in the original

as usual, you ca't improve on perfection - never try to remix or stufy you favourites too clsesly

it's the ack of fancy eetra shit that keeps it slight stark and cold and painful

i think maybe the smiley/sad and bleak touch is why it makes me cry every single time.

or maybe it's a perfect sum up of a life los to the [past...

Juslin and Västfjäll's BRECVEM model
Juslin and Västfjäll developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.[43][44]

Brain stem reflex: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense."
Rhythmic entrainment: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener."[45]
Evaluative conditioning: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction."
Emotional contagion: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then 'mimics' this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion."
Visual imagery: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music."
Episodic memory: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the 'Darling, they are playing our tune' phenomenon."[46]
Musical expectancy: "This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music."

Musical expectancy
With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.[47] Musical expectancy is defined as a process whereby an emotion is aroused in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music. Every time the listener hears a piece of music, he or she has such expectations, based on music he or she has heard before. For example, the sequential progression of E-F# may set up the expectation that the music will continue with G#. In other words, some notes seem to imply other notes; and if these musical implications are not realized — if the listener's expectations are thwarted — an affective response might be induced.[48]

Aesthetic judgement and BRECVEMA
In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.[49] This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

if music theory isdefined 'xxx` then surely `yyy` results dependin on all the factors dictated bu juslin. i.e the reason i find music theory such utter bs nd it doesnt click for me is it is all based on the assmptions::
a) i'm the guy writing the theory - which for the most part implies
	- i'm listenng to/creating classical orchestral
	- i'm using 12tet, thinking about concert tuning a440, blah blah - even so most jazz or  the for 	  the beatles [fucking trite annoying pun name] or elvis or ...
	- assumes i'm [?]sober [unlikely, therefore at least ame state as writer - therefore 	  			  sober/alcohol/ccannabis/opium/etc. upon ar least initaial exerience], and likewise for all other 	  factors. 

therefore, i need a new music theory for me. reconsider based on my personal aesthetc, experiences, life events, significance applied, influences, interests, mental illness, love or pattern/math/science/etc., my biology/psychology/philosophy/etc.

- i like techno. i like synths. i like contrast of  'soft light harmonic sweet gentle, more natural, beauty' destroyed' by 'harsh intense powerful raw distorted bass and synthetic modern'.
- i.e. i like pattern, repeat, loop, no beginning/end. [control issues/safety in predictable]
- non-prescriptive set predictable ound by social norm violin/piano/bras/etc. - i like freedom of plasticity of sound. [see moogle on synth/moduular vs. lgbtqia+/trans especially.]
- i like not only muchly the subvert/surprise, but also the clash, the excitment of what electronic dance music [taboo;my gens rocknroll/jazz/etc.;drug;see later] represents vs. [the comforts of folk/classical orchestral/even classic rock n pop; 'warm'; non-linearitiy filled; acoustic; trad instrument; western trad harmonic/theory/etc.]* - all the thrill/excite/explore/boundary push of one but bounded by the comfort/safety/no har  sef or others of the trad.


as a rresult, reconsider all key features taugt by thory as essential componets of musc theory emotional 'elicit' as far as climed even if not quite iteral real:
- harmonic cadence [think - 'has to be at _end_ of _phrase_ as dictaed by _harmonic rhythm_ rules? etc]
- tempo [see ppers on stimulate = higher pulse vs. lower, comfortfrom personal, mental illness - mania and emotional response to percieved musical experience]
- volume [see annoyance vs pleasure in hilariously male vs. female papers.]tc.-  


example:

`According to William Russo harmonic rhythm is, "the duration of each different chord...in a succession of chords."[3] According to Joseph Swain (2002 p. 4) harmonic rhythm, "is simply that perception of rhythm that depends on changes in aspects of harmony." According to Walter Piston (1944), "the rhythmic life contributed to music by means of the underlying changes of harmony. The pattern of the harmonic rhythm of a given piece of music, derived by noting the root changes as they occur, reveals important and distinctive features affecting the style and texture."[4]

Strong harmonic rhythm is characterized by strong root progressions^ and emphasis of root positions^, weak contrapuntal bass motion^, strong rhythmic placement in the measure^ (especially downbeat^), and relatively longer duration^^.[5]

"The 'fastness' or 'slowness' of harmonic rhythm is not absolute, but relative,"[6][self-published source] and thus analysts compare the overall pace of harmonic rhythm from one piece to another, or the amount of variation of harmonic rhythm within a piece. For example, a key stylistic difference between {Baroque music} and {Classical-period music} is that the latter exhibits much more variety of harmonic rhythm, even though the harmony itself is less complex.

For example, {the first prelude (BWV 846) from J. S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier}, illustrates a steady harmonic rhythm of one chord change per measure, although the melodic rhythm is much faster.`

^all assume trad  western music, especially classical orch/folk, and ^^less so but stil affected by same issue. total ignoe all specifcs oflistener.
{srsly, even _try_ to step outide of classical?}


nevertheless, from my pov, som will be rrelevant due exposure/general similarites in music eperience to some degree, therefore, kalk:
- insta ovrview looks 16 bars of 4/4, each chord is  bars of 4beats long @nominal 30bpm.
- deeper shows subtle 1/16th delay each chord start/chang.
- although 130 [easily lower bound of an intense hard techno 'banger'] feels, not _slow_  but definitely _no rush_ - i.e., you can dance, there's movement, there's no boredom - were going somewhere, but you're ok, you got all the tme in the world...

- paul uses:
[cmaj/-e/^g 	gmaj^d		fmaj/-c/^c	emaj7(gmaj-b-d)/^eve	fmaj/-a^a^c	gmaj/-d^d	amin/-a-eve^c	gmaj-b-d^g]
		  ^	    	     ^			  ^					    	      ^
- sounds/feels like:
[c/g(min7?)	g(majmin7?)	f(majmin7?)	e(min7?)		f(maj7?)	g(maj7?)	c(majmin7?)	g(root+7?)]     		

- to simplify is actually just:
[cmaj-e		bmin^f#		amin^e		gmaj-b-d+e		fmaj		gmaj		amin-a		gmaj-b-d] chords changed by note -/+/^/v
[oct+g		oct+d		oct+c		oct+/-e			oct+ac		oct+d		oct+c/oct-e	oct+g   ] extra accent notes from oct+/-
- roots:
[g		g		f		e			f		g		e		g	]
- note, ableton midimonitor reads as:  
[5		maj		maj		empty			maj		maj		empty		empty	]

- compare to chordify
[cmaj		bmin		amin		gmaj		   	fmaj	        gmaj	  	amin		gmaj    ]



cmaj no e gives an insta coldness - it lacks, the double high accented gmaj n fmaj next are beyond sweet maj - just sheer happy elate, the lesser accent +e/g/-d-b is subtler happy but tho still there as maj lacks again, fmaj gmaj ce/-a all accented high are uplift but have lost sommething from previous double accented maj's ; v much note, amin with f/- especially the amin lacking it's a and the dropped f, and the final g/-b-d tho v subtle high accented and gives the req resolve that's enough is so lacking it v much leaves empty but questions...?

this use of e percieved as root following from prvious bar throws it emin7 instead gmaj - much gospel, carries the scae dscending and is less boring/bviiouus,, lil touch of emote - .


melody is
- f#/b/e in fisrt six pairs  provide slight dip  to flat then back melody, but last pair switches to [invs cmaj;dmaj;fmaj - is v uplift n resolve up]/[real cmaj;cdim;dmin - lil more gospel n calm]  
- 1/16ths
- always comes in whole beat [4/16 late]
- 2bars then trails off into lingering space for next 2bar, repeat on/off. [excep last pair whe there's repeat offset in the norml space]

look into ospel -repeat feel comes over  - gospelhymnal from paul version.








*[hehehe - phsychologists/psychistrists who don't know me, don't panic - i'm well studied, assessed, appropriately medicated, and more crucially have sufficient insight/empathy such that not only  am iquite harmless, but also i shuld stress that in my entire life i have never even so much as had a problematic thought without immediately seeking help of doctor,  actually prgressed as far as displyng any actual intent to carry out any behaviours such tastes in music/emotional exerience for pleasure might lead ne to conclude could be a risk of occurrence. otoh, i do find i far more worrying what it leads me to read into the music/movies/books/poetry/etc. of others...**]***

**see separate thoughts on maybe well known life histories/mental states of e.g. jack kerouac, hst, quentin tarantino, hitchcock, etc. but also - wtf happened to or was inside [look up some people who experienced war/made extremes but so familiar not to be thought about music]

***write an overview cover note for whole site maybe...? [hehehe - add pic of iasip dennis, pref as serial killer as possible, mentioning skin luggage] - allows for inclusion of previously questioned artworks like 'winrape game review'






hallelujah!

lets do a gospel cover!
