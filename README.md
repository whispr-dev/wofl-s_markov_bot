# wofl-s_markov_bot

he's just the simplest of markov bots using Pythons markov library and some extra stuff relating to sorting and filtering output data

he worsk best with about 50kb or bigger `text_data.txt` but technically can work with anything.

code:
- /he's written in Python and is only a few lines long but can produce hilarious output.
- i'd lie to expand him to gather data from a discord channel or something and use that as his database so perhaps this clalls for web webhooks ro something.

so from now on i'm iinstigating some new policies as i go through and tidy up all these nightmare initial commits:
- anmely the most inportan tbeing i'm keeping full revision history but old versions will be saved in a sub folder stucture the top of which is labelled `old`.
- furthermore all the documentation where i was guided through development which makes up a set of learning exercies will be archve dalong with it.

in this simple example there's just one layer of subfoldewwr containing the 6 or 7 earlier versions of markov relevantly numbered and dated etc.
