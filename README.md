# wofl-s_markov_bot

he's just the simplest of markov bots using Pythons markov library and some extra stuff relating to sorting and filtering output data

he worsk best with about 50kb or bigger `text_data.txt` but technically can work with anything.

code:
- /he's written in Python and is only a few lines long but can produce hilarious output.
- i'd lie to expand him to gather data from a discord channel or something and use that as his database so perhaps this clalls for web webhooks ro something.
